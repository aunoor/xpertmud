Xpertmud, the xtensible PERL-Scriptable MUD Client.

This is new incarnation of old, abandoned version from SourceForge.

Now Xpertmud ported to Qt5 and CMake build system. It can run on Windows, MacOS and Linux.

Because there are no significal changes from original now, current version set only to 3.2.0,
and still alfa.

Main advantages of Xpertmud also saved: support Python and Perl scripting (Ruby in plans),
and, of course, Battletech HUD plugin is fully functional.
