For those of you who don't have root access to a machine
but want to have a local copy of xpertmud to play with
nontheless, install with:

./configure --prefix=/your/home/dir/.kde[3]

Be careful to specify the absolute pathname.
The executable will be installed in ~/.kde/bin.
Now all you need to do is to set $PATH correctly
to start mudding..

Attention: The standard scripts are now
in your personal directory, so make a save copy
of them before playing around.
