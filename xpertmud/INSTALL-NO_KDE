Here an little explanation on how to compile xpertmud on Linux using the
Source/quirks originally designed for windows, that is, without KDE but with
the compat dir.

might be usefull for debugging the compat stuff, and should contain the same
bugs as the windows version (given the QT lib really behaves the same on
windows/linux)

start with a fresh checkout.

> qmake xpertmud.pro
> make
> make INSTALL_ROOT=/tmp/xmud_test/ install

> cd xpertmud/scripting/perl
> make -f Makefile.am srcdir=. PERL=perl generated
( if this step fails/shows error messages, 
> chmod +x pl2h.pl createCallbacks.pl
> rm Auto* sysinit_plf.h
and retry )

> PERL=perl qmake libxmperlinterpreter.pro
> make INSTALL_ROOT=/tmp/xmud_test/ install

At this point, you should have an working xpertmud with perl.
to try it:
> cd /tmp/xmud_test
> ./xpertmud-qt

Now compile the hud plugin:
> cd ../../plugins/battletech/
> qmake xmud_battletech.pro
> make
> make INSTALL_ROOT=/tmp/xmud_test/ install

and you should be ready to run.
