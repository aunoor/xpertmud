<div class="window-title">About</div>
<div class="window-content">
<p>Xpertmud is an extensible 
<a href="http://www.perl.org/">perl</a>, 
<a href="http://www.python.org/">python</a> and
<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">ruby</a> 
scriptable MUD client. 
It is based on <a href="http://www.trolltech.com">Qt</a> and
<a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE</a>. There's a native Linux/KDE version
as well as a native Windows/Win32 build. This enables you to use the
same script on your Linux box at home and on your Windows box at work...</p>
<p>It supports multiple windows (which are scriptable), and you can 
use triggers, aliases or whatever you want on every bit of text that 
comes from or goes to the server. There's a stable and intuitive plugin API,
so you can extend the client with Qt-based C++ code. A sample plugin for
the btech MUX is included.</p>

2004-0i3-30 Text Widget rewrite!
</div>
<div class="news-content">
<p>
Well, I finally got to do the much needed Text Widget rewrite.
Some features are still missing, as the splitscreen and copy-n-paste
but that will follow soon. The speed so far looks very promising and 
I hope to get to the rest of the features soon. I also rewrote the 
ANSI-Parser due to a change in the class relations. It seems to work
perfectly, but it still needs some testing. If you want to take a look
at it, checkout the CVS.

<p>
Installing xpertmud from source is now as easy as "emerge xpertmud",
the ebuild honors the "python" and "ruby" USE flags, so you don't have 
to install any unwanted language.

<p>Well, it already has been a year, so we decided to make a CVS 
snapshot available for download. The release is named 3.1preview1, 
and, unfortunately, there are still lots of known and unknown bugs
in it :(. (This one even ain't alpha quality...)</p>
<p>Workarrounds for the most common issues are presented in the

2003-01-23 Xpertmud 3.0beta1
</div>
<div class="news-content">
<p>Before starting to code major changes, we decided that another
bugfix version of xpertmud should be out. The beta1 fixes various
bugs (like crashes when connecting to some mud servers and ANSI
color issues). And it should also fix some build problems that
were reported. So if you've had problems with the alpha, we
<b>strongly encourage you</b> to try this version.</p>
<p>Oh, and a little tip: If you got an error with python when
building xpertmud, tell configure where your python 2 binary
is. On some redhat versions, for example, it's 
--enable-python=/usr/bin/python2.2. Python version less than 2.0
will not work.</p>

2003-01-07 I've got a vision...

<div class="news-content">
<p>Reading some news about Qt/XEmacs and other scriptable editors
I realized that the Xpertmud codebase offers all the technology
to write the next generation scriptable editor. A vi and xemacs
substitue. If you are a developer and like to share visions,
read the <a href="vision.html">Vision document</a>. If you don't
know the design Xpertmud offers, read the

2002-12-23 Xpertmud 3 Win32 Announcement!
</div>
<div class="news-content">
In case nobody noticed :-) Xpertmud Win32 has been shipping for some
time now. Hit the download page and get it (it's at the bottom of
the sourceforge download page). There's a (very short) installation
instruction included (what-you-need...), but there are a few more
very important things to be mentioned:
<ul>
<li>You need python or perl. If you don't know both, I recommend python.</li>
<li>Goto www.python.org. Download the latest python. Install it.</li>
<li>Goto our download page. Hit Download. Get xpertmud-win32-3.0alpha2.zip.</li>
<li>Unzip the file! Find xpertmud.exe with your file manager, start it!</li>
<li>If the client states: library blabla cannot be found, don't panic.
Probably it's just a wrong default language. Head into 
Settings-Configure_Xpertmud-Scripting and set the default interpreter to
the one you installed. Exit Xpertmud, start it again, and all should be
fine.</li>
<li>Browse the online docs. #help or %help will help!</li>
<li>Head into File-Edit_Bookmark, select Start_Interpreter from the
scripting tab, then choose your interpreter. In the Connections
tab hit add, enter your mud's connection (23 is the telnet port),
and hit OK. Then File-Save. Save it. Before anything happens *grin*.
Now hit Connection-Connect and ... MUD!</li>
<li><b>If you've got feedback or questions, ask us(!!!)</b></li>

2002-09-08 Xpertmud 3 Alpha Release
</div>
<div class="news-content">
<p>Good news, this is the first kde3-enabled release. There's
no new documentation yet, and it still has some bugs, but
while playing it's stable enough to go on many, many hours
without problems (The bugs are mainly when switching scripting
engines and while shutting down).</p>
<p>There's the new plugin engine, containing a simple example
plugin and the new battletech plugin we're currently working on.
Then there's the new scripting mouse api, which you can learn
by looking into battletech.pl and searching for "registerMouse".
And last but not least the key event layout slightly changed
to be able to stay compatible with the upcoming Win32 versions.
</p>
<p>Look on the <a href="download.html">download page</a>
to get your mud experience. And go on muddin'.</p>
