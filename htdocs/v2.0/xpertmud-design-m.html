<div class="window-title">Xpertmud Design Overview</div>
<div class="window-content">
Xpertmud has a very flexible and modular design. There
are some basic components which are best described by
looking at the directory structure of xpertmud's cvs.
<ul>
<li><b>xpertmud/</b><br />
Xpertmud's main components. These are qt and kde dependent and
show xpertmud's basic design. The files in here include the
telnet handler, ansi control parser and xpertmud's main widgets.
<ul>
 <li><b>plugins/</b><br />
All plugins for xpertmud. Plugins are simply Qt widgets which
follow a generic (not xpertmud specific) interface. 
These can be called from scripts
via the scripting API. There's a subdir for each interpreter.
The scripting docs are here, too, because the docs for perl
and python are very alike.</li>
 <li><b>scripting/</b><br />
Here you find the glue that connects xpertmud to the scripting
interpreters (currently perl and python). The interpreters
are implemented as dynamic libraries, which implement the
scripting api.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>qextmdi/</b><br />
A qextmdi fork for xpertmud. Solves some issues where qextmdi
didn't fit xpertmud's needs.</li>
<li><b>compat/</b><br />
Files that are required to compile xpertmud without kde and/or
with Qt 2.3. These enable us to compile xpertmud with
a native win32 MFVC.</li>
</ul>
