<p>Xpertmud has quite a lot of features other clients lack by using
full featured programming languages like perl or python
for scripting. This means, that Xpertmud supports for example
databases as long as perl and python support them. 
Xpertmud just provides a comfortable scripting interface
and GUI. We'll soon add a feature table, where we'll
show you the features of other mud clients (like zmud)
and how you can implement/use them in Xpertmud.</p>
<p>Implemented Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using full programming languages (Perl/Python) as
scripting languages.</li>
<li>Nice GUI bindings for scripting languages (open 
multiple windows, print to windows using ANSI
control sequences).</li>
<li>Scripting callbacks for text entered in the GUI and
received from the mud. Enables you to program aliases
and triggers.</li>
<li>Bindings for key-press events (enables you to
implement Num-Pad walking and hot-keys).</li>
<li>Scripting callbacks for timers.</li>
<li>Nice functions to handle your callbacks easily
within the command line environment or scripts.</li>
<li> Bindings to send text to the server from scripts.</li>
<li>Dcop scripting capabilities.</li>
<li>Nice plugin support. Simply put a widget into
a plugin and write some wrapper code in the
scripting language to use the plugin. Enables
you to write any kind of control widgets or
time-critical calculations using C++.</li>
<li>Multi-Line line edit. Just press ctrl-enter
to get a new line of input.</li>
<li>Mud Compression Protocol.</li>
<li>Support for charset negotiation over telnet</li>
<li>Support for lots of different charsets, including full utf8 support</li>
</ul>
<p>Upcoming Features (works mostly/partially):</p>
<ul>
<li>Bindings for mouse events in windows. Enables
you to implement map scrolling, easy text buttons,
selections etc.</li>
<li><b>Win32</b> and <b>MacOS X</b> Port</li>
<li>Plugin for "Rapid Gui Development" utilizing (D)HTML 
and javascript (konqueror based)</li>
</ul>
<p>Planned Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mud Chat Protocol.</li>
<li>Plugin structure for input plugins.</li>
<li>"Bookmark-local" config storage usable by scripts.</li>
<li>New Text Widgets, fast drawing and scrolling again.</li>
<li>Small script adding some TF compatible wrappers for xpertmud functions</li>
<li>A (non-battletech) mapper plugin</li>
</ul>
