<div class="window-content">
<p>Xpertmud is very modular and flexible. The idea is to
use the design and knowledge available with xpertmud to create a
new tool, or a set of new tools which use the same
scripting and plugin interface. This would enable the
community to share a lot of code. In this document I
propose a way how this might be done. Of course this
requires more manpower, and I hope this document will
inspire some of you out there to join the project.</p>
<p>The main idea evolved, when I read some threads about
Qt/XEmacs and some other python-scriptable editors.
I realized that all the technology that is needed to
build a flexible, scriptable and pluginable editor
is right now available within the xpertmud code. So
why not use this as a starting point to create a
<b>Xpert Development Environment</b>, a programming
environment for extensible (think plugins), perl, python and (see lower) 42
scriptable applications.</p>
<p>The best way to look at this proposed environment is
in my opinion to look at it in terms of a new directory (think module)
hierarchy:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>widgets/</b><br />
Some widgets which qt doesn't have, but which are usable in
many applications. This includes modular
and extensible fixed font widgets.</li>
<li><b>telnet/</b><br />
Basic telnet classes, which feature a very extensible, modular
and easy way to code telnet applications. This is already 
available in the xpertmud codebase.</li>
<li><b>ansi/</b><br />
A flexible and modular ansi parser. Also available in the
xpertmud codebase.</li>
<li><b>plugin/</b><br />
A library that allows Xpert applications to use plugins from
within scripts. This is strongly coupled to xpert-script.</li>
<li><b>script/</b><br />
The environment to include scripting languages in Xpert
applications. Because the scripting API is very application
dependent this needs to feature a meta-compiler, which creates
API files and binding library code from API specs and some
code skeletons.
<ul>
<li><b>fourtytwo/</b><br />
A very basic scripting language, which enables Xpert applications
scripting without being dependent on 3-rd party tools. There
should be an easy way to compile perl, python and other language
code from fourtytwo. Fourtytwo must have exactly the features
Xpert applications need to fulfill their basic scripting needs.
Not more and not less. Then application developers just code their
extensions once, and the user can easily switch to other supported
languages if they need more power in their own scripts.</li>
<li><b>apicompiler/</b><br />
A compiler that reads the scripting api in some yet-to-define
format and generates C++ Classes that provide the glue
between the scripting language and the application. The
way the api is specified limits the possible scripting languages
the environment can support in the future (think types), so
this has to be done very carefully. The application coder just
specifies the api and some C++ code that has to be executed
once the callback is called. Using skeletons for the different
scripting languages, apicompiler compiles not only some
classes to use in the application, but also all the code
for the dynamic library, which embeds the scripting interpreter.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>mdi/</b><br />
A new (or qextmdi based) mdi for Xpert applications which need it.</li>
<li><b>compat/</b><br />
Everything that is needed to compile Xpert applications without
kde and/or Qt 2.3 (think compatibility classes). There are
already many of those in the xpertmud repository.</li>
<li><b>xpertmud/</b><br />
Our good old xpertmud client after some code cleanup.</li>
<li><b>xperted/</b><br />
An extensbile, scriptable and pluginable editor for kde and windows.
Being a kpart it can be embedded for example in kdevelop. Being
pluginable it can easily do expensive things like code completion.
Being scriptable many things can be done simply with perl,
python or 42.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now if you're as excited as I am about writing the next
generation cross platform editor, please drop me a mail
and/or subscribe to the (very, very low traffic at the
moment) xpertmud mailinglist. This will only be possible
(and probably this will only be begun) if enough people
join. Ernst and I can't do all this at the moment, but
I know there are many talented coders out there!</p>
<p>
So long,<br />
